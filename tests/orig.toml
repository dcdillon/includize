## Table

# Tables (also known as hash tables or dictionaries) are collections of
# key/value pairs. They appear in square brackets on a line by themselves.

[table]

key = "value" # Yeah, you can do this.

# Nested tables are denoted by table names with dots in them. Name your tables
# whatever crap you please, just don't use #, ., [ or ].

[table.subtable]

key = "another value"
